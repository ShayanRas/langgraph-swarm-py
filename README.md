# ü§ñ LangGraph Multi-Agent Swarm 

A Python library for creating swarm-style multi-agent systems using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). A swarm is a type of [multi-agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent) architecture where agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-agent collaboration** - Enable specialized agents to work together and hand off context to each other
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable handoff tools** - Built-in tools for communication between agents

This library is built on top of [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a powerful framework for building agent applications, and comes with out-of-box support for [streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/#streaming), [short-term and long-term memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/) and [human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph-swarm
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) is crucial for maintaining conversation state across multiple interactions. Without it, the swarm would "forget" which agent was last active and lose the conversation history. Make sure to always compile the swarm with a checkpointer, e.g., `workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)`
